# Agricultural Informatics Lab Projects

## Overview

This repository contains a series of lab exercises for the Agricultural Informatics Lab, covering web development, data analysis, farm management system implementation, GIS visualization, and machine learning applications in agriculture.

## 🔬 Lab Descriptions

** 📌 Lab 1: Building the Front-End with HTML & CSS **

Developed a responsive web interface using HTML and CSS.

Designed layouts and styled elements to create an interactive user experience.

** 📊 Lab 2: Exploring USDA NASS Data with Python **

Fetched and analyzed agricultural data from the USDA NASS database.

Processed, cleaned, and visualized trends in agricultural statistics using Python.

** 🌱 Lab 3-5: Developing a Farm Management System with Django **

Set up a full-stack farm management system using Django.

Built front-end templates and integrated them with Django views.

** 🗺️ Lab 6: Working with and Visualizing Geometric Data **

Processed spatial agricultural data using GIS libraries.

Created interactive maps and visualizations to analyze farm layouts.

** 🤖 Lab 7: Image Classification with TensorFlow **

Applied deep learning techniques to classify agricultural images.

Used TensorFlow to train and evaluate convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
